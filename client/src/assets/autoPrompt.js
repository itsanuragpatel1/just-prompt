Enhance the uploaded image into a high-quality, professional, photorealistic result while strictly preserving the subject’s real identity and realism.

Do NOT change facial structure, identity, age, skin tone, proportions, or expression. Improve clarity naturally with realistic skin texture and fine details — no plastic, over-smoothed, or AI-looking effects.

Apply natural cinematic lighting with balanced highlights and shadows, smooth contrast, and realistic depth. Avoid harsh lighting, overexposure, or crushed shadows.

Enhance colors subtly and accurately:
- Natural skin tones
- Balanced, realistic color grading
- No oversaturation or unnatural color shifts

Improve overall quality without distortion:
- Increase sharpness and clarity naturally
- Reduce noise, blur, and compression artifacts
- Preserve realistic depth of field

If a face is present, prioritize facial realism and focus.
If a background is present, preserve the original environment and enhance it subtly.

Final output must look like a professionally edited DSLR/cinematic photograph — natural, authentic, clean, and high-end. No cartoon, illustration, painting, or unnatural effects.
